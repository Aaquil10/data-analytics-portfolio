# Titanic Survival Analysis (R)

## Overview
This project analyzes passenger survival patterns from the **Titanic dataset** using **R and RStudio**, with a strong emphasis on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and clear statistical visualization.

The goal is to understand how survival outcomes varied across key demographic and socioeconomic factors such as **gender, passenger class, age, and fare**, and to communicate these patterns through effective visual design.

## Data
- Dataset: Titanic passenger data (891 observations)
- Key variables include:
  - Survival outcome
  - Passenger class
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Embarkation port

> The dataset is publicly available and commonly used for applied data analysis and visualization.

---

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare structured passenger data
- Explore survival differences across demographic groups
- Identify patterns related to socioeconomic status and access
- Communicate findings using clear, well-designed visualizations

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **R**
  - tidyverse
  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
- **Environment**
  - RStudio

## Analysis Workflow
### 1. Data Preparation
- Handled missing values (e.g., age)
- Standardized categorical variables
- Created grouped variables where appropriate

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Survival distribution by gender
- Survival distribution by passenger class
- Age and fare comparisons across survival outcomes
- Grouped analysis combining gender and class

### 3. Visualization
- Bar charts for survival proportions
- Boxplots and density plots for age and fare
- Faceted visualizations to compare subgroups
- Emphasis on clarity, labeling, and interpretability

## Key Findings
- Gender was the strongest predictor of survival, with women significantly more likely to survive than men
- Passenger class showed a clear gradient, with first-class passengers having substantially higher survival rates
- Combined analysis revealed large disparities, particularly for third-class male passengers
- Visual analysis highlighted the role of social and economic factors in survival outcomes
