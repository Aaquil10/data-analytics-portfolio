# DC Traffic Crash Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes traffic crash data from Washington, DC to identify patterns related to crash severity, location, and contributing factors. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for traffic safety and urban planning.

## Data Source
Publicly available DC traffic crash data, including information on crash location, time, severity, weather conditions, and contributing factors.

## Objectives
- Clean and validate large-scale crash datasets
- Explore trends in crash severity across time and location
- Identify high-risk patterns to support traffic safety initiatives

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL
- Microsoft Excel

## Key Analysis Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Geographic and temporal trend analysis
- Visualization of crash severity and frequency

## Key Outcomes
- Identified patterns in crash severity by time of day and location
- Highlighted high-risk intersections and corridors
- Generated insights relevant to traffic safety and policy analysis

## Status
Completed. Code and analysis notebooks will be added.
