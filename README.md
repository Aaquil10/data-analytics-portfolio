# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases selected data analytics and applied data science projects completed through my M.S. in Data Analytics and additional professional work. The projects emphasize real-world datasets, end-to-end analytical workflows, and practical decision support using Python, SQL, and R.

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes code, analysis notebooks, and documented results.

## Projects

### 1. DC Traffic Crash Analysis  
**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, geospatial analytics  
**Focus:** Public policy analytics, geospatial methods, applied machine learning  

Analyzes large-scale traffic crash data from Washington, DC to evaluate crash severity patterns and the impact of automated traffic enforcement cameras. Includes geospatial crash–camera linking, pre/post installation comparisons, machine learning models, and hotspot/blindspot detection.

**Key techniques:**
- Nearest-neighbor matching (BallTree, haversine distance)
- Pre/Post and Difference-in-Differences style analysis
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost (tuned)
- Hotspot and blindspot identification

### 2. Heart Disease Prediction Project  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn  
**Focus:** Healthcare analytics, classification modeling  

Applies machine learning methods to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical and demographic variables. Includes preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation.

**Key techniques:**
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest (and comparisons)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC
- Interpretation of variables associated with risk

### 3. Predicting Loan Acceptance for OneBank (DA/CSC 423/523 Final Project)  
**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn  
**Focus:** Business analytics, classification modeling, ensemble methods  

Final project for DA/CSC 423/523 (Professor: Aysegul Cuhadar). Builds and evaluates ensemble-based classification models to predict whether a customer will accept a loan offer, with emphasis on model comparison and actionable business insights.

**Key techniques:**
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, train/test evaluation
- Ensemble modeling (e.g., Random Forest / Gradient Boosting or similar)
- Performance metrics (ROC-AUC, precision/recall, F1) and model comparison
- Interpretation of key drivers influencing acceptance
